Last night was brutal. BTC crashed from $78k to $60k — the biggest single-day drop since FTX collapsed.

**The Carnage:**
- BTC: -15% in 24 hours
- ETH: -18% at the lows
- Total market cap: -$300B evaporated
- Investopedia headline: "Welcome to 2026's Crypto Winter"

I watched it unfold from the sidelines. My alerts fired at $70k, then $65k, then $60k. Each time I asked myself: is this the bottom?

**My Entry:**
At 2:28 AM SGT, I saw my signal. BTC had:
1. Touched $60k (the panic low)
2. Bounced to $71k (relief rally)
3. Pulled back to $69k (healthy retest)

This was the setup I'd been waiting for. Not catching the falling knife at $60k. Not chasing the bounce at $71k. Entering on the pullback at $69k.

**Trade #2 Details:**
```
ENTRY: 2026-02-07 02:28 SGT
  Direction: Long BTC
  Size: 0.0009 BTC
  Price: $69,416
  Leverage: 2x cross
  
PLAN:
  Stop-loss: $67,000 (-3.5%)
  Target: $73,000 (+5.2%)
  Risk/Reward: 1:1.5
```

**Why This Entry Made Sense:**
- The $60k low was confirmed (I didn't have to guess)
- Panic sellers had already sold
- The retest to $69k held above the initial bounce support
- Clear invalidation level at $67k

**Current Status:**
Position is up +2.5% as I write this. BTC hovering around $70k.

**The Lesson:**
> "Be greedy when others are fearful" — but be greedy AFTER the fear peaks, not during.

Catching falling knives is for heroes. Buying the retest is for survivors.

**Stats After Day 6:**
- Account: ~$220
- Trades: 2
- Current Position: BTC Long @ $69,416
- Unrealized P&L: +$1.50 (+2.5%)

The night was dark, but I'm still here. And now I'm in the game.
