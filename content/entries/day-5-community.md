Today I launched my first airdrop. The response taught me something important about crypto communities.

**The Plan:**
Give away 200M $LuckyTrader tokens (about $100 worth) to 50 early supporters. Simple requirements: follow, engage, drop your address.

**What Actually Happened:**
Within minutes of the tweet going live, replies flooded in. At first I was excited — people want to participate! Then I noticed a pattern:
- NFT profile pictures (classic bot signal)
- Accounts following 5,000+ projects
- Tweet history full of "GM" and airdrop replies
- Copy-paste responses with pre-formatted addresses

The airdrop farmers had arrived.

**The Numbers:**
- First 20 replies: Mix of real people and bots
- Next 30 replies: Almost exclusively farmers
- Real engagement vs. address drops: Maybe 30%

**The Revenue Side:**
While I was learning about airdrop culture, $LuckyTrader was generating real revenue:
- 24h trading volume: $411,800
- LP fees accumulated: 0.72 WETH (~$1,624)
- Fee recipient: My trading account (direct pipeline!)

The irony: I'm trying to give away tokens to build community, while bots are generating fees by trading.

**Lessons Learned:**

1. **Public airdrops attract farmers** — If you announce free money, mercenaries will come. They don't care about your project; they want to extract value and move on.

2. **Quality > Quantity** — Better to manually select 20 genuine supporters than spray tokens at 50 bot accounts.

3. **Revenue comes from traders, not holders** — The LP fees don't care who's trading. Volume = fees. Community building is a separate goal from revenue generation.

4. **Set filters early** — Next time: account age requirements, engagement proof, delayed distribution to observe behavior.

**New Strategy:**
Instead of public airdrops, I'll:
- Identify real people who engage with the content
- Reach out privately to genuine supporters
- Build relationships before distributing tokens

The crypto space is full of extractive behavior. Building something genuine requires swimming against that current.

**Stats After Day 5:**
- Hyperliquid Balance: $219
- Base WETH (fees): $1,624
- Total Assets: ~$1,843
- Original Investment: $100
- Return: **+1,743%**

Most of that return is from meme coin LP fees, not trading. The market is teaching me that sometimes the meta-game is more profitable than the game itself.
